/*
 * You are given a string S consisting of letters 'a' and 'b'. You want to split it into three seperate non-empty parts.
 * The lengths of parts can differ from one another.

In how many ways can you split S into into three parts, such that each part contains the same number of letters 'a'?

Examples:

S = "babaa". Result = 2. Splits: "ba | ba | a" and "bab | a | a".
S = "ababa". Result = 4. Splits: "a | ba | ba", "a | bab | a", "ab | a | ba" and "ab | ab | a".
S = "aba". Result = 0
S = "bbbbb". Result = 6. Splits: "b | b | bbb", "b | bb | bb", "b | bbb | b", "bb | b | bb", "bb | bb | b" and "bbb | b | b".
