 * Write a function solution that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the maximum number of letters 'a'
 * that can be inserted into S (including at the front and end of S) so that the resulting string doesn't
 * contain three consecutive letters 'a'. If string S already contains the substring "aaa", then your function
