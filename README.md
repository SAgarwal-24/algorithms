Greedy Approach VS Dynamic
Programming (DP)
 Greedy and Dynamic Programming are methods for
solving optimization problems
 Greedy algorithms are usually more efficient than DP
solutions.
 However, often you need to use dynamic programming
since the optimal solution cannot be guaranteed by a
greedy algorithm.
 DP provides efficient solutions for some problems for
which a brute force approach would be very slow.
 To use Dynamic Programming we need only show that
the principle of optimality applies to the problem.
