Greedy Approach VS Dynamic
Programming (DP)
Greedy and Dynamic Programming are methods for
solving optimization problems
Greedy algorithms are usually more efficient than DP
solutions.
However, often you need to use dynamic programming
since the optimal solution cannot be guaranteed by a
greedy algorithm.
 DP provides efficient solutions for some problems for
which a brute force approach would be very slow.
 To use Dynamic Programming we need only show that
the principle of optimality applies to the problem.
