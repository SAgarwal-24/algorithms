In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph.

Since tree is a major topic itself, I created a separate directory for tree instead of making it nested under graph directory.

Usually, most problems about trees can be solved in depth-first and breadth-first fashion. So, I did not create dedicated directories for these depth-first and breadth-first solutions since I would have to duplicate almost all of the problems in these two separate directories. These solutions will be included in the single source file of the problem. I did not place tree solutions in bfs-dfs directory since tree questions carry a common pattern amongst themselves.
