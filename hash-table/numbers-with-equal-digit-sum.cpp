Write a function that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the
maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal
sum. If there are no two numbers whose digits have an equal
sum, the function should return .1.

Examples:

1. Given A = [51, 71, 17, 42],the function should return 93. There
are two pairs of numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum:
(51,42) and (17, 71). The first pair sums up to 93.

2. Given A = [42, 33, 60], the function should return 102. The
digits of all numbers in A add up to the same sum, and choosing
to add 42 and 60 gives the result 102.

3. Given A = [51, 32, 43], the function should return -1, since all
numbers in A have digits that add up to different, unique sums.

Write an efficient algorithm tenths following assumptions:

   • N is an integer within the range [1..200,0001
   • each element of array A is an integer within the
     range [1..1,000,000,000).
